# builtin functions
print(round(2.9))  # Rounds to nearest integer (standard)
print(abs(-2.9))  # Returns positive version of the number
# functions from math module ~ here math is a object so that we can access its methods like we access from the object
print(math.ceil(2.2))  # Output: 3 ~ Rounds up to nearest integer
print(math.floor(2.9))  # Output: 2 ~ Rounds down to nearest integer
print(math.factorial(5))  # Output: 6 ~ Returns factorial of the number
