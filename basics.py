# starter code ~ Sudharsan (May 5, 2025)
# print is more like a console.log in js to print output
print("Hello World")
# expression ~ Expression is a piece of code that returns a value
print("*" * 10)

# beautiful code according to Python Enhancement Proposals ~ Refer: PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code
x = 7

# variables
# We use variables to store data in computer’s memory, Ex: students_count = 1000 => when we run this program, python interpreter will allocate some memory and store this number thousand in that memory space,
students_count = 1000


# What kind of data we can store in computers memory ?
# - We have several kinds of data, Some builtin primitive data types are Numbers, Booleans and Strings

# ~ 1. Numbers
# a) Whole Number / integer in programming
blogs_count = 100
# b) Float / Floating point number ~ more like a decimal number
blog_rating = 4.5

# ~ 2. Booleans
# Boolean is a primitive data type that can have only two values: True or False ~ These are most likely used in taking decisions
is_published = True
is_published = False

# ~ 3.String ~ A sequence of characters, like a sentence or a word
course_name = "Python Programming"

# Tip ~ from we learned so far
# 1. all variable names should be descriptive and meaningful
# 2. all variable names should be in lowercase
# 3. all variable names should be separated by underscore if it is a multi word variable name
# 4. all variable names should not start with a number
# 5. all variable names should have space around the equal sign (pep 8)


# Some useful things to do with string
# 1) triple quote ~ mostly used in mail templates

# 1. Everything in Python is an object ~ Even basic things like integers, strings, lists — all of them are objects of specific classes:

# 10 → an instance of the int class

# "10" → an instance of the str class
